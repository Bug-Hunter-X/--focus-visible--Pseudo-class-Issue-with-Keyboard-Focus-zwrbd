The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class does not occur as anticipated.  The button element does not display the default focus outline when using a keyboard. This is unexpected because the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class should only apply styles when the element receives focus using the keyboard and not a mouse click.

```css
button {
  outline: none;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```
